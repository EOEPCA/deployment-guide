# Quickstart

The deployment of the EOEPCA components and the supporting Kubernetes cluster is described in the sections [**Cluster**](../cluster/prerequisite-tooling.md) and [**EOEPCA**](../eoepca/persistence.md). These sections should be consulted for more detailed information.

**Scripted Deployment**

As a companion to these descriptions, we have developed a set of scripts to provide a demonstration of an example deployment. This is described in the following section [Scripted Deployment](scripted-deployment.md).

**Customised Deployments**

The Scripted Deployment can be quickly exploited through the following customisations for particular use cases:

* **[Simple](simple-deployment.md)**<br>
  _Basic local deployment_
* **[Processing](processing-deployment.md)**<br>
  _Deployment focused on processing_
* **[Data Access](data-access-deployment.md)**<br>
  _Deployment focused on the Resource Catalogue and Data Access services_
* **[User Management](userman-deployment.md)**<br>
  _Deployment focused on the User Management services_
* **[CREODIAS](creodias-deployment.md)**<br>
  _Deployment with access to CREODIAS EO data_

Each customisation is introduced in their respective following sections.
