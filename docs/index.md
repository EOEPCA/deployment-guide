# Deployment Guide

The Deployment Guide describes how each building-block comprising the EOEPCA Reference Implementation is configured and deployed. A full system deployment is described, in which components are deployed with complementary configurations that facilitate their integration as a coherent system. Nevertheless, each component can be cherry-picked from this system deployment for individual re-use.

The deployment is organised into the following sections:

* **Cluster**<br>
  Establish the Kubernetes cluster and other prerequisites for the deployment of the EOEPCA system.
* **EOEPCA**<br>
  Deployment of the EOEPCA components.
