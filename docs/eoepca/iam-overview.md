# IAM Overview

This guide includes two approaches for Identity & Access Management:

* [Keycloak Solution](identity-service.md) (NEW)
* [Gluu Solution](login-service.md) (deprecated)

Until now, our IAM solution has been based solely upon Gluu.

In the course of the project Keycloak has emerged as a preferred solution across EO platforms.

Thus, we have introduced an IAM approach based upon Keycloak, whilst retaining the Gluu-based approach for reference, which will be deprecated.
