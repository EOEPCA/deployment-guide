# IAM Overview

This guide includes two approaches for Identity & Access Management:

* Keycloak Solution (NEW)
* Gluu Solution (deprecated)

Until now, our IAM solution has been based solely upon Gluu. In the course of the project Keycloak has emerged as a preferred solution across EO platforms. Thus, we have introduced an IAM approach based upon Keycloak, whilst retaining the Gluu-based approach which will be deprecated.
