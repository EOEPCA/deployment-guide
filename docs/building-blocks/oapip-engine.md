# Processing - OGC API Processes Engine

## Introduction

The **OGC API Processes Engine** provides an OGC API Processes execution engine through which users can deploy, manage, and execute OGC Application Packages. The OAPIP engine is provided by the [ZOO-Project](https://zoo-project.github.io/docs/intro.html#what-is-zoo-project) `zoo-project-dru` implementation - supporting OGC WPS 1.0.0/2.0.0 and OGC API Processes Parts 1 & 2.

- **Standardised Interfaces**: Implements OGC API Processes standards for interoperability.
- **Application Deployment**: Supports deployment, replacement, and undeployment of applications.
- **Execution Engine**: Executes applications using Kubernetes and Calrissian for CWL workflows.

---

**Clone the Deployment Guide Repository:**

```
git clone -b 2.0-beta https://github.com/EOEPCA/deployment-guide
cd deployment-guide/scripts/processing/oapip
```

**Validate your environment:**

Run the validation script to ensure all prerequisites are met:

```
bash check-prerequisites.sh
```

---

## Deployment

### Run the Configuration Script

```bash
bash configure-oapip.sh
```

**Configuration Parameters**

- **`INGRESS_HOST`**: Base domain for ingress hosts.
    - *Example*: `example.com`
- **`CLUSTER_ISSUER`** (if using `cert-manager`): Name of the ClusterIssuer.
    - *Example*: `letsencrypt-prod`
- **`STORAGE_CLASS`**: Storage class for persistent volumes.
    - *Example*: `default`

**Stage-Out S3 Configuration:**

Before proceeding, ensure you have an S3-compatible object store set up. If not, refer to the [MinIO Deployment Guide](../infra/minio.md). These values should already be in your EOEPCA+ state file if you followed the main deployment steps.

- **`S3_ENDPOINT`**, **`S3_ACCESS_KEY`**, **`S3_SECRET_KEY`**, **`S3_REGION`**: Credentials and location details for the S3 bucket used as Stage-Out storage.

**Stage-In S3 Configuration:**

If your Stage-In storage differs from Stage-Out (e.g., data hosted externally), specify these separately:

- **`STAGEIN_S3_ENDPOINT`**, **`STAGEIN_S3_ACCESS_KEY`**, **`STAGEIN_S3_SECRET_KEY`**, **`STAGEIN_S3_REGION`**

---

### Configure IAM Integration for OAPIP

**Creating a Keycloak Client for OAPIP:**

Follow the steps in [Client Administration](../iam/client-management) to create a new Keycloak client for OAPIP. Use the following values when prompted:

- **`clientId`**: `oapip-engine`
- **`rootUrl`** and **`baseUrl`**: `https://zoo-apx.${INGRESS_HOST}`
- **`redirectUris`**: `https://zoo-apx.${INGRESS_HOST}/*` and `/*`
- **`client_secret`**: Use the `${OAPIP_CLIENT_SECRET}` generated by the `configure-oapip.sh` script.
- **`authorizationServicesEnabled`**: `true` to enable Keycloak’s built-in authorisation features.

Once the client is created, note its `clientId` and secret, as these are required by OAPIP for integrating with the IAM system.

**Create Keycloak Resource for Zoo 'jobs' endpoint**

Zoo provides a 'jobs' endpoint for monitoring of process executions and providing details of processing results. The details of each job is presented behind a unique Job ID (as a uuid) known only to the originating user. Thus, access to the `/ogc-api/jobs/` endpoint need not be protected explicitly for each user, as the random uuid job IDs provide protection through obscurity.

To configure this policy, the Keycloak resource that represents this jobs endpoint is configured using the built-in 'default' resource type, which invokes the default policy that authorises access for any authenticated realm user.

Follow the steps under **Create a Resource** in [Resource Protection with Keycloak Policies](iam/advanced-iam.md#resource-protection-with-keycloak-policies) to create the `jobs` resource in the `zoo` client with the `type` set as `urn:zoo:resources:default`.

This is achieved with the following resource definition...

```json
{
  "name": "jobs",
  "type": "urn:zoo:resources:default",
  "uris": ["/ogc-api/jobs/*"]
}
```

---

### Apply Kubernetes Secrets

Run the script to create the necessary Kubernetes secrets.

```bash
bash apply-secrets.sh
```

### Deploy the OAPIP Engine Using Helm

```bash
helm repo add zoo-project https://zoo-project.github.io/charts/ && \
helm repo update zoo-project && \
helm upgrade -i zoo-project-dru zoo-project/zoo-project-dru \
  --version 0.3.6 \
  --values generated-values.yaml \
  --namespace processing \
  --create-namespace
```

### OAPIP Engine Ingress

Note the ingress for the OAPIP Engine is established using APISIX resources (ApisixRoute, ApisixTls). Ensure that you have the APISIX Ingress Controller installed and configured in your cluster, as described in the [APISIX Ingress Controller](../prerequisites/ingress-controller.md) section.

```bash
kubectl -n processing apply -f generated-ingress.yaml
```

The ingress definition introduces integration with Keycloak for request authorization - which is illustrated in the section [Apply Resource Protection](#apply-resource-protection).

---

## Apply Resource Protection

OAPIP endpoints can be protected by Keycloak policies e.g. limiting access to certain users or groups. Follow the steps in [Advanced Configuration](../iam/advanced-iam#resource-protection-with-keycloak-policies) to:

1. **Create a Group or Role in Keycloak** (e.g., `team-eoepca`).
2. **Add Users to That Group/Role**: Ensure the `eoepca` test user (or your chosen users) are members.
3. **Create a Policy and Resource**: In the context of your `oapip-engine` client, define which paths (like `/eoepca`) are protected.
4. **Create Permissions Linking the Policy to the Resource**.

Use the `oapip-engine` `clientId` you created above. For an example, see the IAM documentation’s resource protection steps. Just substitute the `myclient` or `oapip-engine` references accordingly.

---

## Validation

### Automated Validation

This script performs a series of automated tests to validate the deployment.

```bash
bash validation.sh
```

### Web Endpoints

Check access to the service web endpoints:

* **ZOO-Project Swagger UI** - `https://zoo-apx.<INGRESS_HOST>/swagger-ui/oapip/`
* **OGC API Processes Landing Page** - `https://zoo-apx.<INGRESS_HOST>/ogc-api/processes/`


### Expected Kubernetes Resources

Ensure that all Kubernetes resources are running correctly.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n processing
```

**Expected Output:**

- All pods should be in the `Running` state.
- No pods should be in `CrashLoopBackOff` or `Error` states.

---

### Via OGC API Processes

Validate the operation of the `zoo` service via its OGC API Processes interfaces.

Depending on your validation needs we offer two sample applications that can be used to exercise the deployed service...

* `convert` - a very simple 'hello world' application that is quick to run, with low resource requirements, that can be used as a smoke test to validate the deployment
* `water_bodies` - a more real-world application that performs processing of EO input data

In the following sections select the path `convert` vs `water_bodies` that suits your needs.

NOTE that the following API requests assume use of the `eoepca` test user.


#### Authenticate

Please refer to the [IAM User Authentication](../iam/client-management#obtaining-tokens-via-the-device-flow) section for details on how to authenticate as the `eoepca` user to obtain an `access_token`.

---

#### List Processes

Retrieve the list of available (currently deployed) processes.

```bash
source ~/.eoepca/state
curl --silent --show-error \
  -X GET "https://zoo-apx.${INGRESS_HOST}/eoepca/ogc-api/processes" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${access_token}" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" | jq
```

---

#### Deploy Process

Deploy the application that meets your validation needs.

---

##### Deploy - `convert`

Deploy the `convert` app...

```bash
source ~/.eoepca/state
curl --silent --show-error \
  -X POST "https://zoo-apx.${INGRESS_HOST}/eoepca/ogc-api/processes" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${access_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/ogcapppkg+json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d @- <<EOF | jq
{
  "executionUnit": {
    "href": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EOEPCA/deployment-guide/2.0-beta/scripts/processing/oapip/examples/convert-url-app.cwl",
    "type": "application/cwl"
  }
}
EOF
```

Check the `convert` application is deployed...

```bash
source ~/.eoepca/state
curl --silent --show-error \
  -X GET "https://zoo-apx.${INGRESS_HOST}/eoepca/ogc-api/processes/convert-url" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${access_token}" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" | jq
```

---

##### Deploy - `water_bodies`

Deploy the `water_bodies` app...

```bash
source ~/.eoepca/state
curl --silent --show-error \
  -X POST "https://zoo-apx.${INGRESS_HOST}/eoepca/ogc-api/processes" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${access_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/ogcapppkg+json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d @- <<EOF | jq
{
  "executionUnit": {
    "href": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EOEPCA/deployment-guide/2.0-beta/scripts/processing/oapip/examples/app-water-bodies-cloud-native.1.5.0.cwl",
    "type": "application/cwl"
  }
}
EOF
```

Check the `water_bodies` application is deployed...

```bash
source ~/.eoepca/state
curl --silent --show-error \
  -X GET "https://zoo-apx.${INGRESS_HOST}/eoepca/ogc-api/processes/water_bodies" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${access_token}" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" | jq
```

---

#### Execute Process

Initiate the execution of the deployed application.

Execute either `convert` or `water_bodies` - depending on your needs.

In either case the `JOB ID` of the execution is retained for use in subsequent API calls.

---

##### Execute - `convert`

```bash
source ~/.eoepca/state
JOB_ID=$(
  curl --silent --show-error \
    -X POST "https://zoo-apx.${INGRESS_HOST}/eoepca/ogc-api/processes/convert-url/execution" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${access_token}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -H "Prefer: respond-async" \
    -d @- <<EOF | jq -r '.jobID'
  {
    "inputs": {
      "fn": "resize",
      "url":  "https://eoepca.org/media_portal/images/logo6_med.original.png",
      "size": "50%"
    }
  }
EOF
)
```

---

##### Execute - `water_bodies`

```bash
source ~/.eoepca/state
JOB_ID=$(
  curl --silent --show-error \
    -X POST "https://zoo-apx.${INGRESS_HOST}/eoepca/ogc-api/processes/water_bodies/execution" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${access_token}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -H "Prefer: respond-async" \
    -d @- <<EOF | jq -r '.jobID'
  {
    "inputs": {
      "stac_items": [
        "raw.githubusercontent.com/EOEPCA/deployment-guide/2.0-beta/scripts/processing/oapip/examples/stac-item.json",
      ],
      "aoi": "-6.059593683367105,53.123645037009204,-4.727280797333244,54.133792015262706",
      "epsg": "EPSG:4326",
      "bands": [
        "green",
        "nir"
      ]
    }
  }
EOF
)
```

---

#### Check Execution Status

The `JOB ID` is used to monitor the progress of the job execution - most notably the status field that indicates whether the job is in-progress (`running`), or its completion status (`successful` / `failed`). Note that the full URL for job monitoring is also returned in the `Location` header of the http response to the execution request.

```bash
source ~/.eoepca/state
curl --silent --show-error \
  -X GET "https://zoo-apx.${INGRESS_HOST}/ogc-api/jobs/${JOB_ID}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${access_token}" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" | jq
```

---

#### Check Execution Results

Similarly, once the job is completed successfully, then details of the results (outputs) can be retrieved.

```bash
source ~/.eoepca/state
curl --silent --show-error \
  -X GET "https://zoo-apx.${INGRESS_HOST}/ogc-api/jobs/${JOB_ID}/results" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${access_token}" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" | jq
```

The STAC files and assets comprising the results are referenced as links to object storage. Access the object storage console to inspect these outputs - see the [Object Storage description](../infra/minio.md) for more details.

---

#### Undeploy Process

The deployed application can be deleted (undeployed) once it is no longer needed.

---

##### Undeploy - `convert`

```bash
source ~/.eoepca/state
curl --silent --show-error \
  -X DELETE "https://zoo-apx.${INGRESS_HOST}/eoepca/ogc-api/processes/convert-url" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${access_token}" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" | jq
```

---

##### Undeploy - `water_bodies`

```bash
source ~/.eoepca/state
curl --silent --show-error \
  -X DELETE "https://zoo-apx.${INGRESS_HOST}/eoepca/ogc-api/processes/water_bodies" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${access_token}" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" | jq
```

---

## Uninstallation

To remove the Processing Building Block from your cluster:

```bash
helm -n processing uninstall zoo-project-dru
```

### Additional Cleanup

- **Delete Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs):**

  ```bash
  kubectl -n processing delete pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=zoo-project-dru
  ```
