# Storage Requirements

Some EOEPCA Building Blocks, particularly those involved in processing (e.g. the CWL Processing Engine), require shared storage with `ReadWriteMany` access. This allows multiple pods to read and write to the same volume concurrently.

**Key Requirements:**

- **ReadWriteMany Volumes**  
    - Mandatory for the CWL Processing Engine and potentially other BBs requiring concurrent file access.
- **Appropriate StorageClass**  
    - The cluster must have a default or specialized StorageClass that can dynamically provision `ReadWriteMany` volumes.

## Production vs. Development

- **Production**  

    - Use robust solutions like GlusterFS, IBM Spectrum Scale, or fully managed cloud file systems that support `ReadWriteMany`.
    - Tools like OpenEBS or Longhorn can provide distributed block storage, but ensure they truly support multi-node RWX if your usage demands it.
    - NFS can be used if carefully configured for high availability and reliability.

- **Development / Testing**  

    - A simple NFS server or an OpenEBS/Longhorn single-node install might suffice for demos.
    - HostPath or local volumes can be acceptable for quick tests, but not recommended for multi-node or production usage.

**Which EOEPCA Blocks Require `ReadWriteMany`?**

- **Processing Building Blocks**: For instance, the CWL Processing Engine needs shared file access.

Make sure to check which Building Blocks you plan to deploy and ensure the clusterâ€™s StorageClass and volume provisioning match these requirements.
